    <h1>lain.rocks XMPP server Terms of Service</h1>
    <h2>What we provide?</h2>
    <p>
      We run an XMPP server, that lets you chat with other XMPP users, we
      believe in simplicity, privacy and not getting in your way. These Terms Of
      Service ("Terms") explain the basic rules for using our service. By using
      it you agree to those terms.
    </p>
    <h2>Ground rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No spam, abuse, illegal stuff (under US and Czech law)</li>
      <li>Don't break our or other networks</li>
      <li>Don't harass people</li>
      <li>Don't try to crash or overload our servers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We're very relaxed but we will ban you if necessary.</p>
    <h2>Privacy</h2>
    <p>We do NOT:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Log your conversations</li>
      <li>Sell your data (who would want to even buy that anyways)</li>
      <li>Track you</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We just don't care, We have no interest in what you do, as long as it's
      not illegal ;)
    </p>
    <p>
      We log IP addresses temporarily, to prevent abuse; for example to
      automatically block vulnerability scanning bots, the IP logs get deleted
      after a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the glowies come with a warrant, we will try NOT to comply, but please
      understand that we MAY HAVE TO DO SO. We don't retain much information
      anyways, so if you're smart, you have nothing to worry about.
    </p>
    <h2>Accounts and Data</h2>
    <p>
      You create an account with a username and password, no emails or anything
      like that. DO NOT forget your password, we CANNOT recover it for you, it's
      hashed; as in UNRECOVERABLE, we can change it if you ask nicely, just
      email Us.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can delete your account at any time (obviously), no questions asked,
      your data is wiped
    </p>
    <h2>Availability</h2>
    <p>
      We try to keep a maximum uptime (see home page for status monitoring)
      however we are not a corporate product with an SLA, although we try to
      alert before any longer downtimes.
    </p>
    <h2>Policy changes</h2>
    <p>
      We will put a notice on the homepage if any changes to the policy occur.
    </p>

      <li>Miscommunications</li>
      <li>Your parents getting divorced</li>
    </ul>
